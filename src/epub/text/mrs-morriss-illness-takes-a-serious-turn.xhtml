				<p>Washington, <abbr>Jan.</abbr> 10.⁠—<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Minor Morris, who on Thursday was dragged from the White House, is tonight in a critical condition.</p>
				<p>She seemed to be on the road to recovery on Saturday, and her physicians held out hopes that she would be able to be out by Monday. At the beginning of this week her condition took an unfavorable turn, and she has been growing steadily worse. She had a congestive chill today and has continued to grow worse. It is evident tonight that her nervous system has suffered something approaching a collapse.</p>
				<p>The bruises inflicted upon her by the policemen have not disappeared, a striking evidence of their severity. Her arms, shoulders, and neck still bear testimony to the nature of her treatment. Mentally and physically she is suffering severely.</p>
				<p>It was learned today that two Cabinet officers, one of whom is Secretary Taft, have been laboring with the President for two days to get him to issue a statement disavowing the action of Assistant Secretary Barnes, who ordered <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Morris expelled, and expressing his regret for the way she was treated. They have also urged him to promise to take action which will make impossible the repetition of such an occurrence.</p>
				<p>The President has held out stoutly against the advice of these two Cabinet officers. He authorized <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Barnes to make the statement that he gave out, in which the treatment of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Morris was justified, and it is not easy to take the other tack now. On high authority, however, it is learned that the two Cabinet officers have not ceased their labors. They both look on the matter not as “a mere incident,” but as a serious affair.</p>
				<p>The Morris incident was brought up in the House today just before adjournment by <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Sheppard of Texas. He was recognized for fifteen minutes, in the ordinary course of the debate on the Philippine Tariff bill, and began at once to discuss the resolution he introduced Monday calling for an investigation of the expulsion. He excused himself for speaking on the resolution at this time, saying that as it was not privileged he could not obtain its consideration without the consent of the Committee on Rules.</p>
				<p>He went on to describe the incident at the White House. He had proceeded only a minute or two when he was interrupted by General Grosvenor, who rose to the point of order that the remarks were not germane to the Philippine Tariff bill.</p>
				<p>“I will show the gentleman that it is germane,” cried <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Sheppard. “It is just as proper for this country to have a Chinese wall around the White House as it is to have such a wall around the United States.”</p>
				<p>“Well, if he thinks it is proper to thus arraign the President and his household,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Grosvenor, “let him go on.”</p>
				<p>“If the President had heard the howl of a wolf or the growl of a bear from the adjacent offices,” retorted <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Sheppard, “the response would have been immediate, but the wail of an American woman fell upon unresponsive ears.”</p>
				<p>There had been several cries of protest when General Grosvenor interrupted <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Sheppard, many of whose Democratic friends gathered about him and urged him to proceed. They applauded his reply to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Grosvenor, and the Ohioan did not press his point.</p>
				<p>“These unwarrantable and unnecessary brutalities,” continued <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Sheppard, “demand an investigation. Unless Congress takes some action we shall soon witness in a free republic a condition where citizens cannot approach the President they have created without fear of bodily harm from arbitrary subordinates.”</p>
				<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Sheppard had nearly reached the close of his remarks when <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Payne, the titular floor leader of the Republicans, renewed the Grosvenor point of order. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Olmstead of Pennsylvania, in the chair, however, ruled that with the House sitting in Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union, remarks need not be germane.</p>
				<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Payne interrupted again, to ask a question.</p>
				<p>“If a gentleman has the facts upon which to found his attack,” he said, “does he not think the police court is the better place to air them?”</p>
				<p>“The suggestion is a reflection upon the gentleman himself, although he is a friend of mine,” replied Sheppard.</p>
				<p>When the speech was finished Grosvenor got the floor and said he had been aware of the rules when he did not press his point.</p>
				<p>“But I made the point,” he continued, “merely to call the attention of the young gentleman from Texas in a mild and fatherly manner to my protest against his remarks. I hoped he would refrain from further denunciation of the President. He has introduced a resolution which is now pending before the proper committee. That resolution asks for facts and I supposed that the gentleman would wait for the facts until that resolution is brought into the House.</p>
				<p>“I know no difference in proper conduct between the President’s office and household and the humblest home in this Nation, but I don’t believe a condition has arisen such that the husband of this woman cannot take care of the situation.”</p>
				<p>A high government official tonight added to the accounts of the expulsion an incident, which he said was related to him by an eyewitness. While the policemen and their negro assistant were dragging <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Morris through the grounds the scene was witnessed by the women servants, some of whom called out, “Shame!” One of the policemen pressed his hand down on <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Morris’s mouth to stifle her cries for help, and at that sight a man servant, a negro, rushed forward and shouted:</p>
				<p>“Take your hand off that white woman’s face! Don’t treat a white woman that way!”</p>
				<p>The policeman paid no attention to the man, and continued his efforts to stifle <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Morris’s cries.</p>
				<p>The reason I want to insert that account of the Morris case, which is making such a lively stir all over the United States, and possibly the entire world, in these days, is this. Some day, no doubt, these autobiographical notes will be published. It will be after my death. It may be five years from now, it may be ten, it may be fifty⁠—but whenever the time shall come, even if it should be a century hence⁠—I claim that the reader of that day will find the same strong interest in that narrative that the world has in it today, for the reason that the account speaks of the thing in the language we naturally use when we are talking about something that has just happened. That form of narrative is able to carry along with it for ages and ages the very same interest which we find in it today. Whereas if this had happened fifty years ago, or a hundred, and the historian had dug it up and was putting it in <em>his</em> language, and furnishing you a long-distance view of it, the reader’s interest in it would be pale. You see, it would not be <em>news</em> to him, it would be history; merely history; and history can carry on no successful competition with <em>news</em>, in the matter of sharp interest. When an eyewitness sets down in narrative form some extraordinary occurrence which he has witnessed, that is <em>news</em>⁠—that is the news form, and its interest is absolutely indestructible; time can have no deteriorating effect upon that episode. I am placing that account there largely as an experiment. If any stray copy of this book shall, by any chance, escape the paper-mill for a century or so, and then be discovered and read, I am betting that that remote reader will find that it is still <em>news</em> and that it is just as interesting as any news he will find in the newspapers of his day and morning⁠—if newspapers shall still be in existence then⁠—though let us hope they won’t.</p>
				<p>These notions were born to me in the fall of 1867, in Washington. That is to say, thirty-nine years ago. I had come back from the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.boat">Quaker City</i> excursion. I had gone to Washington to write <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The Innocents Abroad</i>, but before beginning that book it was necessary to earn some money to live on meantime, or borrow it⁠—which would be difficult, or to take it where it reposed unwatched⁠—which would be unlikely. So I started the first Newspaper Correspondence Syndicate that an unhappy world ever saw. I started it in conjunction with William Swinton, a brother of the admirable John Swinton. William Swinton was a brilliant creature, highly educated, accomplished. He was such a contrast to me that I did not know which of us most to admire, because both ends of a contrast are equally delightful to me. A thoroughly beautiful woman and a thoroughly homely woman are creations which I love to gaze upon, and which I cannot tire of gazing upon, for each is perfect in her own line, and it is <em>perfection</em>, I think, in many things, and perhaps most things, which is the quality that fascinates us. A splendid literature charms us; but it doesn’t charrn <em>me</em> any more than its opposite does⁠—“hogwash” literature. At another time I will explain that word, “hogwash” and offer an example of it which lies here on the bed⁠—a book which was lately sent to me from England, or Ireland.</p>
				<p>Swinton kept a jug. It was sometimes full, but seldom as full as himself⁠—and it was when he was fullest that he was most competent with his pen. We wrote a letter apiece once a week and copied them and sent them to twelve newspapers, charging each of the newspapers a dollar apiece. And although we didn’t get rich, it kept the jug going and partly fed the two of us. We earned the rest of our living with magazine articles. My trade in that line was better than his, because I had written six letters for the New York <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Tribune</i> while I was out on the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.boat">Quaker City</i> excursion, fifty-three for the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Alta Californian</i>, and one pretty breezy one for the New York <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Herald</i> after I got back, and so I had a good deal of a reputation to trade on. Every now and then I was able to get twenty-five dollars for a magazine article.</p>
				<p>I had a chance to write a magazine article about an ancient and moss-grown claim which was disturbing Congress that session, a claim which had been disturbing Congress ever since the War of 1812, and was always getting paid, but never satisfied. The claim was for Indian corn and for provender consumed by the American troops in Maryland or somewhere around there, in the War of 1812. I wrote the article, and it is in one of my books, and is there called “Concerning the Great Beef Contract.” It was necessary to find out the price of Indian corn in 1812, and I found that detail a little difficult. Finally I went to <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">A. R.</abbr> Spofford, who was the Librarian of Congress then⁠—Spofford the man with the prodigious memory⁠—and I put my case before him. He knew every volume in the Library, and what it contained, and where it was located. He said promptly, “I know of only two sources which promise to afford this information, ‘Tooke on Prices’ ” (he brought me the book) “and the New York <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Evening Post</i>. In those days newspapers did not publish market reports, but about 1809 the New York <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Evening Post</i> began to print market reports on sheets of paper about notepaper size, and fold these in the journal.” He brought me a file of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Evening Post</i> for 1812. I examined “Tooke” and then began to examine the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Post</i>⁠—and I was in a great hurry. I had less than an hour at my disposal. But in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Post</i> I found a personal narrative which chained my attention at once. It was a letter from a gentleman who had witnessed the arrival of the British and the burning of the Capitol. The matter was bristling with interest for him and he delivered his words hot from the bat. That letter must have been read with fiery and absorbing interest three days later in New York, but not with any more absorbing interest than the interest which was making my blood leap fifty-nine years later. When I finished that account I found I had used up all the time that was at my disposal, and more.</p>

				<p>That incident made a strong impression upon me. I believed I had made a discovery⁠—the discovery already indicated⁠—the discovery of the wide difference in interest between “news” and “history”; that news is history in its first and best form, its vivid and fascinating form, and that history is the pale and tranquil reflection of it.</p>
				<p>This reminds me that in this daily dictation of autobiographical notes I am mixing these two forms together all the time. I am hoping by this method of procedure to secure the values of both. I am sure I have found the right way to spin an autobiography at last, after my many experiments. Years ago I used to make skeleton notes to use as texts in writing autobiographical chapters, but really those notes were worth next to nothing. If I expanded them upon the page at once, while their interest was fresh in my mind, they were useful, but if I left them unused for several weeks, or several months, their power to suggest and excite had usually passed away. They were faded flowers, their fragrance was gone. But I believe in this present plan. When you arrive with your stenographic plant at eleven, every morning, you find me placid and comfortable in bed, smoking, untroubled by the fact that I must presently get to work and begin to dictate this history of mine. And if I were depending upon faded notes for inspiration, I should have trouble and my work would soon become distasteful. But by my present system I do not need any notes. <em>The thing uppermost in a person’s mind</em> is the thing to talk about or write about. The thing of new and immediate interest is the pleasantest text he can have⁠—and you can’t come here at eleven o’clock, or any other hour, and catch me without a new interest⁠—a perfectly fresh interest⁠—because I have either been reading the infernal newspapers and got it there, or I have been talking with somebody; and in either case the new interest is present⁠—the interest which I most wish to dictate about. So you see the result is that this narrative of mine is sure to begin every morning in diary form, because it is sure to begin with something which I have just read, or something which I have just been talking about. That text, when I am done with it⁠—if I ever get done with it, and I don’t seem to get done with any text⁠—but it doesn’t matter, I am not interested in getting done with anything. I am only interested in talking along and wandering around as much as I want to, regardless of results to the future reader. By consequence, here we have diary and history combined; because as soon as I wander from the present text⁠—the thought of today⁠—that digression takes me far and wide over an uncharted sea of recollection, and the result of that is <em>history</em>. Consequently my autobiography is diary and history combined. The privilege of beginning every day in the diary form is a valuable one. I may even use a larger word, and say it is a precious one, for it brings together widely separated things that are in a manner related to each other, and consequently pleasant surprises and contrasts are pretty sure to result every now and then.</p>
				<p>Did I dictate something about John Malone three or four days ago? Very well, then, if I didn’t I must have been talking with somebody about John Malone. I remember now, it was with <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Volney Streamer. He is a librarian of the Players’ Club. He called here to bring me a book which he has published, and, in a general way, to make my acquaintance. I was a foundation member of the Players’ Club, but ceased to be a member three years ago, through an absurdity committed by the management of that club, a management which has always been idiotic; a management which from the beginning has been selected from, not the nearest asylum in the city, but the most competent one (and some time I wish to talk about that). Several times, during this lapse of three years, old friends of mine and comrades in the club⁠—David Munro, that charming Scot, editor of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">North American Review</i>; Robert Reid, the artist; Saint-Gaudens, the sculptor; John Malone, the ex-actor; and others⁠—have been resenting the conduct of that management⁠—the conduct, I mean, which resulted in my segregation from the club⁠—and they have always been trying to find a way of restoring me to the fold without damaging my pride. At last they found a way. They made me an honorary member. This handsome honor afforded me unlimited gratification and I was glad to get back under such flattering conditions. (I don’t like that word, but let it go, I can’t think of the right one at the moment.) Then David Munro and the others put up the fatted calf for the lost sheep in the way of a dinner to me. Midway of the dinner I got a glimpse, through a half-open pantry door, of that pathetic figure, John Malone. There he was, left out, of course. Sixty-five years old; and his history may be summarized⁠—his history for fifty years⁠—in those two words, those eloquent words⁠—“left out.” He has been left out, and left out, and left out, as the years drifted by for nearly two generations. He was always expecting to be counted in. He was always pathetically hoping to be counted in; and that hope never deserted him through all those years, and yet was never in any instance realized. During all those years that I used to drop in at the Players’ for a game of billiards and a chat with the boys, John Malone was always there until midnight and after. He had a cheap lodging in the Square⁠—somewhere on Gramercy Park, but the club was his real home. He told me his history once. His version of it was this:</p>
				<p>He was an apprentice in a weekly little newspaper office in Willamette, Oregon, and by and by Edwin Booth made a one-night stand there with his troupe, and John got stage-struck and joined the troupe, and traveled with it around about the Pacific coast in various useful histrionic capacities⁠—capacities suited to a beginner, sometimes assisting by appearing on the stage to say, “My lord, the carriage waits,” later appearing armored in shining tin, as a Roman soldier, and so on, gradually rising to higher and higher eminences, and by and by he stood shoulder to shoulder with John McCullough, and the two stood next in rank after Edwin Booth himself on the tragic stage. It was a question which of the two would succeed Booth when Booth should retire or die. According to Malone, his celebrity quite equaled McCullough’s in those days, and the chances were evenly balanced. A time came when there was a great opportunity⁠—a great part to be played in Philadelphia. Malone was chosen for the part. He missed his train. John McCullough was put into that great place and achieved a success which <em>made</em> him for life. Malone was sure that if he had not missed the train he would have achieved that success himself; he would have secured the enduring fame which fell to John McCullough’s lot; he would have moved on through life serene, comfortable, fortunate, courted, admired, applauded, as was John McCullough’s case from that day until the day of his death. Malone believed with all his heart that fame and fortune were right there within his reach at that time, and that he lost them merely through missing his train. He dated his decline from that day. He declined, and declined, and declined, little by little, and little by little, and year after year, until there came a time when he was no longer wanted on the stage; when even minor part after minor part slipped from his grasp; and at last engagements ceased altogether⁠—engagements of any kind. Yet he was always believing, and always expecting, that a turn of fortune would come; that he would get a chance on the stage in some great part; and that <em>one</em> chance, he said, was all he wanted. He was convinced that the world would not question that he was the rightful successor of Edwin Booth, and from that day forth he would be a famous and happy and fortunate man. He never gave up that hope. Three or four years ago, I remember his jubilation over the fact that he had been chosen by some private theatrical people to play Othello in one of the big theaters of New York. And I remember his grief and deep depression when those private theatrical people gave up the enterprise, at the last moment, and canceled Malone’s engagement, snatching from him the greatness which had once more been just within his reach.</p>
				<p>As I was saying, at mid-dinner that night I saw him through the half-open door. There he remained through the rest of the dinner, “left out,” always left out. But at the end of the speeches, when a number of us were standing up in groups and chatting, he crept meekly in and found his way to the vacant chair at my side, and sat down. I sat down at once and began to talk with him. I was always fond of him⁠—I think everybody was. And presently the president of the New York City College came and bent over John and asked me something about my last summer, and how I had liked it up in the New Hampshire hills, at Dublin. Then, in order to include John in the conversation, he asked him if he was acquainted with that region and if he had ever been in Dublin. Malone said dreamily, and with the air of a man who was trying to think up long-gone things, “How does it lie as regards Manchester?” President Finley told him, and then John said, “I have never been to Dublin, but I have a sort of recollection of Manchester. I am pretty sure I was there once⁠—but it was only a one-night stand, you know.”</p>
				<p>It filled my soul with a gentle delight, a gracious satisfaction, the way he said that⁠—“Only a one-night stand.” It seemed to reveal that in his half century of daydreaming he had been an Edwin Booth and unconscious that he was only John Malone⁠—that he was an Edwin Booth, with a long and great and successful career behind him, in which “one-night stands” sank into insignificance and the memory unused to treasuring such little things could not keep tally of them. He said it with the splendid indifference and serenity of a Napoleon who was making an indolent effort to remember a skirmish in which a couple of soldiers had been killed, but was not finding it really worth while to dig deep after such a fact.</p>
				<p>Yesterday I spoke to Volney Streamer about John Malone. I had a purpose in this, though I did not tell Streamer what it was. David Munro was not able to be at that dinner, and so, to get satisfaction, he is providing another, for the 6th of February. David told me the guests he was inviting, and said that if there was anybody that I would like to invite, think it over and send him the name. I did think it over, and I have written down here on this pad the name of the man I selected⁠—John Malone⁠—hoping that he would not have to be left out this time, and knowing he wouldn’t be left out unless David should desire it, and I didn’t think David would desire it. However, I took the opportunity to throw out a feeler or two in talking with Volney Streamer, merely asking him how John Malone stood with the membership of the Players’ now⁠—and that question was quickly and easily answered⁠—that everybody liked John Malone and everybody pitied him.</p>
				<p>Then he told me John Malone’s history. It differed in some points from the history which Malone had given me, but not in essentials, I should say. One fact came out which I had not known about⁠—that John was not a bachelor, but had a married daughter living here somewhere in New York. Then, as Streamer went on, came this surprise: that <em>he</em> was a member of Edwin Booth’s company when John Malone joined it a thousand years ago, and that he had been a comrade of John’s in the company all over the Pacific coast and the rest of the states for years and years. There, you see, an entire stranger drops in here in the most casual way, and the first thing I know he is an ancient and moss-grown and mildewed comrade of the man who is for the moment uppermost in my mind. That is the way things happen when you are doing a diary and a history combined, and you can’t catch these things in any other way but just that. If you try to remember them, with the intention of writing them down in the form of history a month or a year hence, why, when you get to them the juice is all out of them⁠—you can’t bring to mind the details. And moreover, they have lost their quality of surprise and joy, anyway. That has all wasted and passed away.</p>
				<p>Very well. Yesterday <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Rev.</abbr> Joe Twichell arrived from Hartford to take dinner and stay all night and swap some lies, and he sat here by the bed the rest of the afternoon, and we talked, and I told him all about John Malone. Twichell came in after breakfast this morning (the 16th) to chat again, and he brought me this, which he had cut out of the morning paper:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<header class="headline" role="presentation">
						<p>
							<b>Veteran Actor Dead</b>
						</p>
						<p>John Malone Was Historian of<br/>
						The Players’ Club</p>
					</header>
					<p>John Malone, the historian of the Players’ Club and one of the oldest actors in the country, was stricken with apoplexy yesterday afternoon in front of Bishop Greer’s residence, 7 Gramercy Park, a few doors from the club. Bishop Greer saw him fall, and, with the assistance of his servants, carried <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Malone into his house. He was unconscious, and the Bishop telephoned to Police Headquarters.</p>
					<p>An ambulance was sent from Bellevue Hospital, and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Malone was taken to the institution by <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Hawkes. Later the Players’ had him removed to the Postgraduate Hospital, where he died last night.</p>
					<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Malone was sixty-five years old, and supported all the notable actors of a past generation. For a long time he was associated with Booth and Barrett. He had appeared on the stage but infrequently of late years, devoting the greater part of his time to magazine work. He lived with a married daughter in West 147th Street, but visited the Players’ Club nearly every day. He was on his way to the club when stricken.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>So there is another surprise, you see. While Twichell and I were talking about John Malone he was passing from this life. His disappointments are ended. At last he is not “left out.” It was a long wait, but the best of all fortunes is his at last.</p>
				<p>I started to say, a while ago, that when I had seemingly made that discovery of the difference between “news” and “history” thirty-nine years ago, I conceived the idea of a magazine, to be called <i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">The Back Number</i> and to contain nothing but ancient news; narratives culled from moldy old newspapers and moldy old books; narratives set down by eyewitnesses at the time that the episodes treated of happened.</p>
